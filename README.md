# PHP Undefined Offset Notice in Foreach Loop
This example demonstrates a common error in PHP when using foreach loops with arrays.  The code attempts to access elements of an array that may not exist, leading to an 'Undefined offset' notice.
The `bug.php` file shows the erroneous code and the `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version using isset() or empty().
